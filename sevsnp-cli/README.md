# Intel速 Trust Authority SEVSNP CLI

The Intel速 Trust Authority SEVSNP CLI is a command line interface for attesting a SEV-SNP VM with Intel Trust Authority. The CLI must be installed and run inside the SEV-SNP VM. 

**The sevsnp-cli and go-sevsnp are exclusive beta preview features that are designed to work only within the Intel速 Trust Authority Pilot environment. To access these features, you must have a service offer for the Intel速 Trust Authority Pilot. The development of this branch is ongoing, and we encourage you to report any issues you encounter to the product team.**
